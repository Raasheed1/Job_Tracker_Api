## 🧠 Overview

The **Job Tracker API** is a backend system designed to help users manage and track their job applications efficiently.
This API is designed with production-ready practices including caching, background jobs, and CI/CD.

It allows users to:

* Register and authenticate securely  
* Track job applications  
* Update job status over time  
* View complete status history  
* Analyze job statistics  
* Improve performance using caching  

This project focuses on **real-world backend architecture**, **clean API design**, and **scalable structure**.

## 🔐 Features

### 🔑 Authentication

* User Registration  
* Login with JWT  
* Access & Refresh Tokens  
* Secure password hashing  
* Token-based protected routes  
* Logout with token blocklist  

---

### 💼 Job Management

* Create job applications  
* Get all jobs (with filters & pagination)  
* Get single job details  
* Update job details  
* Soft delete jobs  
* Duplicate job prevention  

---

### 📊 Status Tracking

* Track status changes (applied → interview → offer → rejected)  
* Maintain complete history of status transitions  

---

### 📈 Dashboard

* Total jobs count  
* Applied / Interview / Offer / Rejected stats  
* Response rate calculation  
* Stale job detection (based on inactivity, not creation time)  

---

### ⚡ Performance Optimization

* User-specific dashboard caching  
* Manual cache control using:
  - `X-Cache: HIT`
  - `X-Cache: MISS`

---

### 🔄 Background Jobs

* Daily job: identify stale applications  
* Weekly job: clear cached data  

---

### 🛡️ Validation & Error Handling

* Consistent JSON response format  
* Proper HTTP status codes (400, 401, 404, 429)  
* Schema-based validation  

---

## 📬 API Endpoints

### 🔑 Auth

| Method | Endpoint         | Description          |
| ------ | ---------------- | -------------------- |
| POST   | `/auth/register` | Register user        |
| POST   | `/auth/login`    | Login user           |
| POST   | `/auth/refresh`  | Get new access token |
| POST   | `/auth/logout`   | Logout user          |

---

### 💼 Jobs

| Method | Endpoint     | Description                         |
| ------ | ------------ | ----------------------------------- |
| GET    | `/jobs`      | Get all jobs (filters + pagination) |
| POST   | `/jobs`      | Create new job                      |
| GET    | `/jobs/<id>` | Get single job                      |
| PUT    | `/jobs/<id>` | Update job                          |
| DELETE | `/jobs/<id>` | Soft delete job                     |

---

### 📊 History

| Method | Endpoint             | Description             |
| ------ | -------------------- | ----------------------- |
| GET    | `/jobs/<id>/history` | Job status history      |
| GET    | `/dashboard`         | Job statistics          |
| GET    | `/dashboard/stale`   | Stale job detection     |

---

## ⚡ Caching Strategy

Dashboard responses are cached per user.

Cache key format:


```
dashboard_<user_id>
```


Response header shows cache behavior:


```
X-Cache: HIT / MISS
```
---

## 🧠 Stale Job Logic

A job is considered stale if:
- Status = applied  
- AND no activity in the last 7 days  

Uses:
StatusHistory.changed_at (latest activity), NOT created_at.

---

### 🧪 Testing & CI

* Pytest-based test suite  
* GitHub Actions CI pipeline  
* In-memory database for isolated testing  

---

## 🧪 API Testing (Postman)

A complete Postman collection is included covering:

* Auth flow (Register/Login)
* Job CRUD operations
* Status updates & history
* Full request lifecycle

📁 File:

```
/postman/job-tracker-api.postman_collection.json
```

👉 Import this file into Postman to test the API instantly.

## 🚀 Deployment

* Backend hosted on **Render**
* PostgreSQL database hosted on **Railway**
* Environment variables used for secure configuration

---

## ⚙️ Environment Variables

Required variables:

```
DATABASE_URL=your_postgresql_url
SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key
JWT_SECRET_KEY=your_jwt_secret
```

---

## 🧠 Key Learnings

* Designing scalable backend systems  
* Implementing JWT authentication (access + refresh)  
* Database modeling with relationships  
* API design and best practices  
* Performance optimization using caching  
* Handling real-world errors and edge cases  
* Deployment and CI integration  

---

## 📌 Future Improvements

* Redis-based caching  
* Persistent JWT blocklist  
* Expanded test coverage  
* Frontend (React)  
* Docker support

---

## ⚠️ Known Limitations

* JWT blocklist is stored in-memory and resets when the server restarts  
* SimpleCache is not suitable for multi-instance production  
* Scheduler runs inside the app (can be separated in production)
